// COSW30Project //


// Summary //

The purpose of this project is to create a minimalistic dating website. Users will be able to register to the website, login and (ideally) browse other users's profiles. In order to accomplish this, I will use HTML and PHP through the use of forms, a database and SQL. I'd really like to include a directory of user's profiles and the ability to see and edit your own profile which would include the ability to upload profile pictures but we'll see how that pans out.

//Database Planning //

USERS - Table Name

user_id, INT 11, Primary Key, Auto Increment, NOT NULL

email_address, VARCHAR 50, Attributes

password, VARCHAR 100, Attributes
  
first_name, VARCHAR 50, Attributes
  
last_name, VARCHAR 50, Attributes
  
create_date, TIMESTAMP, Attributes
  
last_login, DATETIME, Attributes

// Functionality Outline //

Files marked with a * might be deleted or repurposed. Files marked with a + are possible additions.
